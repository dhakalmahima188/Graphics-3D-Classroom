# Graphics-3D-Classroom
With this we  have a product of a classroom which is reusable in various future openGl projects along with various independent objects which can also be used individually in other projects and improved upon by other developers with us. We aim to do this as a project for which will be still relevant for future endeavors as well as the project for the Computer Graphics Course in the III Year I Part in IOE, Pulchowk Campus.
This project of ours is simply based on computer graphics and done in the cpp graphics.h  along with the cross platform OpenGl.
